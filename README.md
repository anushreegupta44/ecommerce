You want to design an MVP for an ECommerce application. You want to categorise products into various categories 
e.g. Shirt can be in clothing as well as upper wear category. 

Users will be able to create and manage their information (addresses, names, phone) view products list, product details, create and update shopping cart with items  and checkout cart and thus creating an order.

An administrator will be able to Add and delete products and update inventory.
